# Bachelor thesis
This repository illustrates the code for my bachelor project, which centers around the implementation of the Adjoint Differentiation Algorithm for calculating Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) sensitivities.

The project incorporates the following algorithms:
* Monte Carlo Simulations
* Finite Differentation
* Algorithm Adjoint Differentation

The project aims to address the following question:
How can Algorithmic Adjoint Differentiation be employed to determine selected sensitivities related to Credit Valuation Adjustments for options priced through Monte Carlo simulations within a Black-Scholes framework? How can values for these sensitivities be utilized to analyze individual risks associated with Credit Valuation Adjustments?
